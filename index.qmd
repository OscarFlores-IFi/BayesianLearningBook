This is the home for my book **Bayesian Learning - a gentle introduction**, which is still work in progress.

Here is a [pdf](/pdf/BayesBook.pdf) of the book, which will always be available, even after the book gets published.

See the [Notebooks](notebooks.qmd) tab for a set of notebooks for the chapters in the book.

Thanks to [all](halloferrors.qmd) who found typos and error in the book.
