# Bayesian Learning Book
Home for my book-in-progress 'Bayesian Learning'. 

The book has a [website](https://mattiasvillani.com/BayesianLearningBook/) with a [pdf](https://github.com/mattiasvillani/BayesianLearningBook/raw/main/pdf/BayesBook.pdf) version of the book as well as some [notebooks](https://mattiasvillani.com/BayesianLearningBook/notebooks) to go with certain chapters.

Thanks to [all](https://mattiasvillani.com/BayesianLearningBook/halloferrors.html) who found typos and error in the book.
