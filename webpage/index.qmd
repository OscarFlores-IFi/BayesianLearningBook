title: "Bayesian Learning - the book"
---

This the home for my book **Bayesian Learning - a gentle introduction**, which is still work in progress.

Here is a [pdf](../pdf/BayesBook.pdf) of the book.

See the [Notebooks](notebooks.qmd) tab for a set of notebooks for the chapters in the book.

Thanks to [all](../misc/halloferrors.md) who found typos and error in the book.
